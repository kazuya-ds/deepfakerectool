Development of preliminary tool to identify potential deepfakes and provide insights and guidelines to support human decisions in identifying deepfakes. This uses cybersecurity, explainable artificial knowledge, computational photography, and other skills in development.

"Many deep
learning models rely on surface artifacts or background cues and thus are ren-
dered ineffective when faced with sophisticated fakes. Wavelet-transformed fea-
ture extraction [5], [6], shows promise to improve explainability and accuracy,
but is still vulnerable to context, lighting, or language changes. Most deepfake
detection systems are black box models and are subject to adversarial spoofing.
Human-in-the-loop approaches have improved current detection capabilities, but
the lack of a multi-modal approach and systematic enforcement of laws allows
detection systems to be subject to zero-day manipulations and societal harm" (Erukade et al.)
